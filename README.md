# guessinggame
Small guessing game I created in Highschool (2019).
It is a very simple game. You select a range for the computer to guess between, then select the number the program needs to guess.
The program then will guess a number and ask you if that is higher, lower, or the correct number. If it did not guess the number correctly, it will adjust its parameters and guess again, until it guesses correctly.
